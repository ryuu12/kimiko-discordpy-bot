# Kimiko Discord.py Bot

Kimiko is an open-source Discord.py bot . The functionality is not only to be used as a bot, but also for an educational purpose. So everyone could start learning how to make a bot for discord using Python.

## Installation

As always, if you want to make a discord.py bot, you need to install the package first.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install discord.py
```

## Usage

I've already made a template inside the code, so you can change the code to whatever you want. There are some main bot features in the cogs.
- Ban command
- Help command
- Report command
- Kick command
